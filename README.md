# Trivia Bot 3000

## Overview

The Ensurem Trivia Bot 3000 is the revolutionary trivia game where the player provides both the question and answer!

Well, it will be after your help. Please complete the methods found within the `TriviaBot` class so that it works as intended.

* `GetQuestionsAndAnswers`: Retrieve `n` questions and the correct answers from the user and store them in a dictionary.
* `RateTheTrivia`: Ask the user how they think their trivia scores on our proprietary `TriviaRating` scale. And then let them know we feel the same exact way.
* `SaveTrivia`: We don't want to lose such high quality trivia questions, so make sure to save them (and the answers) to disk where nothing could ever happen to them.

And of course please clean up the code and provide comments/documentation where applicable. The engineers who will be maintaining Trivia Bot decades down the road will thank you.

Finally, research has shown that our current prompt of 5 questions is too many. After extensive testing we have determined 3 is the ideal number of questions to ask.
